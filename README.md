# Twitter-tweet-analysis

In this project, we utilize the Selenium library to automate the process of logging into a Twitter account using Python code. Once logged in, the user can search for a specific topic of interest. The relevant tweets related to that topic are then scraped from Twitter.

Following the data scraping, we perform sentiment analysis on the scraped tweets. Sentiment analysis is a technique that allows us to determine whether a piece of text has a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment based on its polarity. In this project, we apply sentiment analysis to the scraped tweets to classify them accordingly.

By combining web automation with Selenium, Twitter data scraping, and sentiment analysis, we can gain insights into the sentiment surrounding a specific topic on Twitter. This project enables the extraction of relevant tweets and provides a sentiment analysis to understand the overall sentiment polarity of the collected data.
